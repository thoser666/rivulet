# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- fix(alerts): **webhook listener closes connections gracefully** — the
  forged-signature loopback test failed on macOS (`ConnectionReset` while
  reading the 403): the server rejected on the signature check and closed
  while the client's request body was still unread, so the peer kernel sent
  RST and destroyed the queued response (Linux/Windows deliver it anyway;
  macOS is the strictest). The listener now drains the announced body on the
  early-reject path (bounded) and every response closes gracefully — flush,
  `shutdown(Write)` FIN, then a short read-drain before drop — so a response
  can never be lost to an RST. Same hardening class as the earlier
  chat-fixture RST fix; no behavior change for valid requests.
- docs(roadmap): **M5 descope annotations** for an honest milestone closure:
  (1) the OBS plugin compatibility layer moves to M11 (new tracking issue
  [#147](https://github.com/thoser666/Rivulet/issues/147)) — the temporary
  native bridge is a transition convenience for existing OBS users, not a
  requirement for Rivulet's own plugin ecosystem; (2) the legacy "Plugin
  system (native Rust plugins)" checklist item is re-scoped to the WASM-first
  framing actually shipped (a native Rust plugin would just be a build of
  Rivulet itself); (3) issue #50 (code signing) is annotated as **waiting on
  certificate purchase** — SignPath Foundation declined the free tier
  (insufficient stars), so Windows needs an OV certificate and macOS needs
  Apple Developer, while Linux GPG signing is already active; (4) the macOS
  live on-device verification is marked **hardware-blocked** (one manual
  session on a physical Mac, no pending engineering work). README M5/M11
  sections, milestone overview table, docs/milestone-quality-gates.md and
  docs/macos-recording.md updated; no code changes.
- feat(plugins): **Phase 3 — capability approval + install flow** (plugin-system
  RFC): `rivulet_core::plugin_registry` scans the per-user install root for
  plugin bundles and owns the persisted approval store (`PluginApprovals`,
  per-plugin/per-capability decisions with default denial; sensitive
  capabilities `secrets`/`capture` stay denied for WASM at the policy choke
  point regardless of the stored approval). The GUI gains a Settings → Plugins
  section: discovered bundles show name/version/publisher/type/host-API/sandbox
  status before activation, a permission-review dialog records Approve/Deny per
  requested capability, and the enable toggle is blocked until every requested
  capability is decided. Decisions persist with the app state (eframe storage)
  and survive restarts. i18n EN/DE; 8 registry unit tests + 6 GUI approval-flow
  tests + `plugin_registry_phase3_is_implemented` pinning guard.
- fix(plugins): PR #142 green — three root-cause fixes on the Phase 2 branch:
  (1) **wasmtime 29 → 48.0.2** clears the six RUSTSEC advisories that failed
  `cargo audit`/`cargo deny` (RUSTSEC-2025-0046, -0118 and the wasi family);
  (2) **epoch-deadline arm after store creation** — with wasmtime ≥ 32 a fresh
  store under `epoch_interruption` traps with `interrupt` on instantiation
  (deadline == current epoch), so every host-import load skipped with
  `InstantiateError`; the runtime now arms a far-future deadline after store
  creation and `invoke_guarded` keeps setting the real per-call wall-clock
  deadline (new regression test `instantiate_with_epoch_interruption_does_not_trap_immediately`, 79 runtime tests);
  (3) **G5 benchmark smoke no longer times out** — the wasmtime dependency
  grew the cold cargo build past the smoke's 120 s subprocess budget; CI now
  pre-builds with `--no-run` (shared cargo cache) before the smoke step and
  the smoke's own timeout is 600 s. `packaging/flatpak/cargo/cargo-sources.json`
  regenerated for the wasmtime tree (1658 new vendored sources).

- spike(m10): code-gen quality spike harness (`scripts/codegen-spike/`) for the Creative Studio's
  model decision — five real overlay prompts (follower alert, goal bar, chat box, poll widget,
  emote rain), `run-spike.sh` driving Ollama with a strict JSON output contract + per-prompt
  metrics, `scripts/validate-overlay.py` objective validator (structure, no-remote/no-CDN,
  no-crash, size, `node --check` JS syntax, animation) with self-test, and a headless-Edge
  (WebView2-engine) screenshot harness for the visual pass. Doc correction: the previously
  listed `qwen3-coder:8b` does not exist in the Ollama library (30b/480b MoE only); the 8 GB-tier
  candidate is `qwen2.5-coder:7b` — model table + open questions + status tracker updated.
  **Spike executed** (RTX 4060 Ti 8 GB): `qwen2.5-coder:7b` wins as default — 4/5 prompts valid
  at 8–15 s (only miss: goal-bar transition/init); `devstral` (14 GB, CPU-offload) 2/5 valid at
  183–291 s + 3 timeouts, but the most complete outputs — quality pick for 16+ GB cards. Artifacts,
  metrics, and review index committed under `scripts/codegen-spike/results/`.

- docs(m10): AI Creative Studio (Spark-like) accepted into the M10 roadmap as a local-first
  chat-driven code-gen studio (browser-source overlays/widgets/scene packages + optional local
  emote/T2I), with first-class **off-switches**: all AI features off by default, a global master
  switch plus per-feature toggles (assistant / creative studio / emote-T2I) and an optional
  "pause while live" override — persisted, localized, mirrored on the M6 remote-companion
  permission pattern. New spec `docs/m10-ai-creative-studio.md` (Spark feature map, Ollama-code
  vs T2I research, platform upload constraints, kill-switch design), README M10 bullets (creative
  studio + AI off-switches + feature-parity rows), M10 quality-gate bullets, and the
  `m10_creative_studio_is_specified_in_readme_gate_and_spec` ci_pinning guard so the README / gate
  / spec cannot drift.
- feat(obs/ws): Mobile & HTTP remote companion (M6, [#99](https://github.com/thoser666/Rivulet/issues/99)) — a phone or browser on the LAN can switch scenes, start/stop recording, and (with explicit permission) start/stop streaming, driven through the authenticated OBS WebSocket v5 server from M5. New `rivulet-obs-websocket::companion` module serves a dependency-free mobile page (inline HTML/CSS/JS, no CDN; pure-JS SHA-256 fallback for `http://` LAN contexts with a FIPS 180-4 self-test) plus a `/config` JSON endpoint, over an explicit loopback/LAN bind (`BindAddress`, default `127.0.0.1`). Security model: LAN binding requires a non-empty obs-websocket password (refused with `io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput`), remote stream start/stop is gated behind `allow_remote_stream_control` (denied with status `205` + "Remote stream start/stop requires explicit permission" on a LAN bind), no access logging, and CSP/nosniff/no-store headers. GUI: Settings → Remote companion section (toggle, page port 4456, LAN bind, stream-control permission, status line, "Open page"), wired to the obs-websocket options via `start_with_options` while keeping the M5 loopback behaviour for local tooling; serde-persisted settings. Coverage: unit tests, end-to-end `tests/companion_smoke.rs` (page/headers, `/config`, permission gate denial+allow over a real client on `0.0.0.0`, LAN-needs-password refusal, missing-password close 4009, shutdown), `Remote Companion Smoke` CI job in the required aggregate, `m6_remote_companion_is_wired_up_and_pinned` ci_pinning guard, docs (`docs/remote-companion.md`, obs-websocket LAN section, README M6 bullet + platform matrix), i18n EN/DE (528 keys), CHANGELOG. Fixes the latent `obs_ws_restart`-never-reset flag while touching the obs-server restart flow.
- feat(distribution): AUR (Arch User Repository) as a distribution target —
  PKGBUILD downloads the AppImage from GitHub Releases, extracts it, and
  installs to `/opt/rivulet/` with desktop integration (icon, .desktop file,
  /usr/bin symlinks). CI validates the PKGBUILD against real releases via
  the Distribution Readiness workflow. No signing required.
- feat(plugins): Plugin System RFC (`docs/plugin-system-rfc.md`) — complete
  design for manifest format (`rivulet-plugin.toml`), WASM sandbox (WASI-based
  isolation), host API (core + capability-gated imports), capability model
  (default denial, user approval, sensitive-capability guardrails), and plugin
  lifecycle (Discovered → Loaded → Active → Inactive → Unloaded) with crash
  isolation, timeout enforcement, and resource limits. Builds on the VST3 host
  boundary shipped in M5 (Z96). Four plugin categories: UI Panel, Audio Effect,
  Video Filter, Integration. Native DLY bridge for OBS-compat and VST3.

- feat(plugins): Phase 1 — Plugin manifest parser and validator
  (`rivulet-core/src/plugin_manifest.rs`). Implements `rivulet-plugin.toml`
  deserialization with strict validation (reverse-DNS ID, semver, resource hard
  caps, platform whitelist, capability audit). 35 unit tests covering parse,
  validate, error variants, edge cases, and default denial.
- feat(plugins): Phase 2 — WASM runtime, sandbox, and lifecycle
  (`rivulet-core/src/plugin_runtime.rs`). wasmtime-based sandbox with
  fuel-based CPU metering per call and epoch-based wall-clock timeouts
  (interrupt traps and out-of-fuel both surface as `InitTimeout`, and the
  previous join-based timeout that arrested every load for the full timeout
  value is gone). Full RFC lifecycle on `PluginHandle`: `activate` /
  `process` / `deactivate` / `unload` with crash isolation and the
  Loaded → Initialized → Active → Inactive → Unloaded state machine
  (processing failure demotes to `Inactive`, deactivate failure unloads).
  Core host imports: `host_log`, `host_config_read`, `host_config_write`
  (host-managed key-value config), `host_time_now`, `host_ui_invalidate`
  (no-op without the `ui` capability). `WasmPluginRuntime::with_fuel` now
  honors its budget. 15 new tests (config round-trip, ui-capability gating,
  lifecycle transitions, process/data passthrough, timeout and fuel-trap
  enforcement, fast-load regression), 31 total. CHANGELOG guards pinned in
  ci_pinning (`plugin_runtime_phase2_is_implemented`).
- feat(distribution): Chocolatey as a distribution target — the second
  Windows package channel, usable before SignPath approval because the
  community repository accepts unsigned installers (with a moderator
  warning): deterministic package generator
  `packaging/windows/generate-chocolatey-package.ps1` renders
  `rivulet.nuspec` + `tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1` from a release tag with
  the portable-ZIP SHA-256 taken from the release's own `SHA256SUMS`
  (re-render byte-compare via `-ValidateOnly` catches drift) and normalizes
  the version for Chocolatey's no-dots prerelease rule
  (`0.65.0-alpha.163` → `0.65.0-alpha163`); Pester tests (8), a
  **Distribution Readiness → chocolatey** dry-run job, ci_pinning guard,
  and a new "Chocolatey" section in `docs/release-platforms.md` that pins
  the milestone-only submission policy (first beta, not weekly alphas —
  every version is a moderated PR).

- feat(distribution): weekly release promotion — the slow lane for
  package-manager channels: the scheduled **Weekly release promotion**
  workflow (`.github/workflows/weekly-promotion.yml`, Mondays 07:09 UTC,
  manual dispatch with an explicit tag supported) picks the newest published
  (== green; check-runs re-verified) release, moves the `weekly-latest` tag
  onto it (deliberately **no** release of its own — the in-app updater reads
  `/releases` and must keep following the fast lane), generates one digest
  changelog for everything since the previous promotion, and updates the
  Scoop bucket via `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN` (falls back to manifest-as-artifact
  with a warning). `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` gained `--from-tag
  <tag>` (promoted-range notes) and `--digest` (features listed, everything
  else rolled into per-section counts) with two new self-test cases; pinned
  by `weekly_release_promotion_is_scheduled_and_safe` in ci_pinning and
  documented under "Promotion cadence" in `docs/release-platforms.md`.

- feat(distribution): Scoop bucket — the first native Windows package channel,
  available already because Scoop (unlike winget) requires no code signing:
  deterministic manifest generator `packaging/windows/generate-scoop-manifest.ps1`
  renders `bucket/rivulet.json` from a release tag with the portable-ZIP
  SHA-256 taken from the release's own `SHA256SUMS` (a manifest can never
  reference an unverified binary; `[ordered]` throughout so re-renders are
  byte-stable and `-ValidateOnly` re-verification catches drift), Pester tests
  (5), a **Distribution Readiness → scoop** dry-run job, the live bucket
  repository [thoser666/scoop-bucket](https://github.com/thoser666/scoop-bucket)
  seeded with the v0.65.0-alpha.163 manifest (install:
  `scoop bucket add rivulet https://github.com/thoser666/scoop-bucket` &&
  `scoop install rivulet/rivulet`), ci_pinning guard, and
  `docs/release-platforms.md` Scoop section- feat(signing): CI notice for automatic SignPath activation — once all
  four `SIGNPATH_*` secrets exist, `check-beta-gate.py` appends "the next
  release signs automatically via SignPath Foundation" to the Beta-Gate
  step summary on every push (pure information, verdict-neutral); notice
  logic extracted into `signpath_note()` with a `--self-test` run by the
  beta-gate CI job and pinned by `beta_gate_checker_is_wired_up`- feat(signing): paste-in SignPath artifact configuration
  (`packaging/signpath/artifact-configuration.xml`) matching the release
  workflow's two upload shapes — a `<zip-file>` root Authenticode-signing
  `rivulet-gui.exe`, `rivulet.exe` and `rivulet-updater.exe`, and an
  `<msi-file>` root signing the MSI whole (no deep signing; the installed
  EXEs are signed in the first request) — plus the required `version`
  parameter the submit steps pass; portal setup after SignPath Foundation
  approval is now a paste-in, pinned by `code_signing_automation_is_wired_up`
  (workflow-vs-XML EXE/MSI coverage, parameter declaration, no pinned
  artifact-configuration slug) and documented in `docs/code-signing.md`
- feat(distribution): Flathub Stage 2 preparation — offline-cargo, reproducible
  Flatpak manifest `packaging/flatpak/org.rivulet.Rivulet.yml`
  (org.freedesktop.Platform/Sdk 25.08 + rust-stable SDK extension, with the
  llvm20 extension providing libclang to bindgen build scripts (libspa-sys),
  cargo builds
  fully offline over the pinned crate archives in
  `packaging/flatpak/cargo/cargo-sources.json` — 1239 crates generated from
  `Cargo.lock` by the official `flatpak-cargo-generator` at a pinned commit and
  consumed as merged flatpak sources (URL + SHA-256, extracted to
  `cargo/vendor/...`), `cargo/config.toml` vendored-sources mapping; honest
  finish-args for screen/audio capture, Vulkan/DRM, PipeWire/PulseAudio,
  stream-ingest + opt-in telemetry network and `$HOME` recordings), desktop
  file + AppStream metainfo + icon; new `.github/workflows/flatpak-build.yml`
  job that re-verifies the crate pin (drift guard), builds and runs the
  official Flathub lint (manifest/appstream/desktop) on the result, plus a
  dry-run **Distribution Readiness → flathub** job; honest scope: the Flathub
  submission PR and its permissions/appstream review stay the external gate
  (see `docs/release-platforms.md`)
- feat(distribution): WinGet Stage 2 preparation — deterministic winget
  manifest generator/validator `packaging/windows/generate-winget-manifest.ps1`
  (singleton manifest v1.6, canonical GitHub asset URL + SHA-256 + MSI
  `ProductCode`/`UpgradeCode`, `-ValidateOnly` re-verification), Pester-pinned
  (14 tests), plus a dry-run **Distribution Readiness → winget** job that runs
  the tests and renders/verifies the manifest against the real release MSI;
  honest scope: the `microsoft/winget-pkgs` submission PR stays the external
  gate (stable identity `Rivulet.Rivulet`, see `docs/release-platforms.md`)
- feat(alerts): native alert ingestion for the chat dock (M5) — new
  `rivulet-core::alerts_ingest` contract: `AlertEvent`/`AlertKind` (Follow,
  Subscribe, GiftSub, Donation, Raid), Streamlabs donation + Twitch EventSub
  follow/subscribe/gift/raid JSON parsers, Twitch EventSub HMAC-SHA-256
  signature verification (`verify_twitch_eventsub_signature`, pinned test
  vector, constant-time compare) and a bounded local `AlertIngest` queue
  (default capacity 64, oldest dropped, `Debug` never leaks entry contents);
  `AlertEvent` has no `Serialize` impl and `sanitize_message` strips control
  chars so events stay privacy-safe; GUI surfaces ingested events as
  color-accented chat-dock entries (Settings → Alerts toggle, honest
  local-only note, Preview button queueing one sample per kind, drain into the
  bounded chat list); i18n DE/EN (471 keys), GUI + core
  tests, docs `docs/alerts-ingest.md`, roadmap M5 Alerts row marked **Done**,
  ci_pinning guard `m5_alerts_ingest_is_native_localized_and_pinned`
- feat(alerts): opt-in loopback webhook receiver — new
  `rivulet-core::alerts_webhook`: dependency-free HTTP/1.1 listener bound to
  **127.0.0.1 only** (off by default) accepting `POST /webhook/streamlabs`
  (Streamlabs donations) and `POST /eventsub/twitch` (Twitch EventSub with
  HMAC-SHA-256 verification against the masked Settings secret; empty secret
  disables the route with 403), bounded bodies (64 KiB) and honest status
  codes (Twitch retries non-2xx); parsed events stream into the same
  `AlertIngest` push path and surface as chat-dock entries; honest scope:
  public HTTPS delivery from providers still needs a forwarder/HTTPS
  terminator or tunnel in front (documented follow-up, like the EventSub
  WebSocket transport); bind errors surfacing as Settings warnings, never
  crashes; i18n DE/EN (479 keys), core + socket-level e2e receiver tests
  (valid delivery + forged signature), docs `docs/alerts-ingest.md`
- feat(alerts): native outbound Twitch EventSub WebSocket transport — new
  `rivulet-core::alerts_eventsub`: dials `wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws`
  (tungstenite + `rustls-tls-webpki-roots`, the same TLS stack `ureq` already
  uses) and keeps a `channel.follow` (v2) / `channel.subscribe` /
  `channel.subscription.gift` / `channel.raid` (v1) session alive with
  automatic reconnect; parses the session lifecycle (welcome/keepalive/reconnect/
  revocation) and pushes notification frames through
  `parse_twitch_eventsub_notification` into the same `AlertIngest`; creates
  the four subscriptions against the Helix API over TLS (masked client ID +
  user token, scopes `moderator:read:followers`, `channel:read:subscriptions`;
  token acquisition/refresh stays a documented follow-up); live Twitch
  delivery needs **no forwarder, no shared secret and no port**; tokens are
  never logged, never `Debug`-printed and never embedded in events; GUI
  Settings → Alerts gains an opt-in EventSub section (masked credentials,
  broadcaster ID, live connection indicator; missing credentials never dial
  out); i18n DE/EN (512 keys), protocol/unit + WebSocket-puppet e2e tests,
  docs `docs/alerts-ingest.md`, ci_pinning guard m5 extended
- feat(telemetry): M5 opt-in, privacy-first usage telemetry — Settings → Telemetry
  toggle (off by default, persisted; opting out clears pending events);
  identifier-free event model in `rivulet-core::telemetry` (enums/codes/booleans
  only, never titles, paths, URLs, stream keys or usernames; a deterministic test
  pins the serialized payload against free-form text); bounded reporter
  (`TelemetryReporter` auto-flushes at 128 events) with a `TelemetrySink`
  interface and **no transport wired in the shipped build** (nothing leaves the
  device; HTTPS ingestion backend stays a documented follow-up); `Startup` once
  per session and `RecordingStop { duration_secs, healthy }` from every platform
  stop path (Windows/Linux/macOS/aux); i18n DE/EN; docs in
  `docs/telemetry.md` + security policy section; ci_pinning guard
  `m5_telemetry_opt_in_is_privacy_safe_and_pinned`
- docs(signing): SignPath Foundation application **submitted** (Sep 2026);
  `docs/signpath-application-draft.md` now records the submission state and
  tracks review / production certificate / portal setup / secrets / first
  signed release as a checklist, and includes the reputation text as sent
- docs(signing): SignPath Foundation application draft
  (`docs/signpath-application-draft.md`) — ready-to-submit application text
  (project description, repo links, build-system openness, security
  posture), linked from `docs/code-signing.md`
- feat(wiki): Spanish as third wiki language — 11 new Spanish wiki pages
  (Home, Getting Started, Recording guide, Streaming, Troubleshooting,
  Windows/Linux/macOS, Discord Setup + Troubleshooting, Development
  Workflow) published to the GitHub wiki; every EN/DE page's
  language-switch line gains the Español link, `Languages.md` lists the
  new language; `check-wiki-translations.py` accepts `--locales de,es`
  (the workflow now checks EN/DE/ES pairs), translated pages are
  recognized by any known locale suffix regardless of configuration (a
  Spanish page is never mistaken for a canonical English page), and both
  sync scripts share the locale list via the new
  `scripts/check_wiki_locales.py` single source of truth (de, es, fr
  pre-registered — adding a language is now a purely mechanical step);
  `sync-wiki-translations.py` skips every translated stem, not just `-de`
- fix(signing): remove `permissions.actions: read` from build-package.yml —
  GitHub rejects a reusable workflow_call file with that top-level
  permission at startup (bisected as the root cause of the CI
  startup_failure on PR #124: with the permission, every CI run died before
  starting; without it, CI starts normally). It is also unnecessary here:
  on public repositories the default `github.token` downloads workflow
  artifacts without extra permission. The pinning guard and
  `scripts/test-signpath-config.py` now assert the permission is ABSENT so
  it cannot silently return; `docs/code-signing.md` gains a
  "Free signing options for open source" comparison table (SignPath
  Foundation free vs Azure Artifact Signing $9.99/mo vs purchased OV/EV
  certificates vs self-signed vs Apple's $99/yr with no free route vs free
  Linux GPG) with an explicit Rivulet recommendation
- feat(signing): SignPath Foundation Windows signing path — Windows
  artifacts (the three executables + the MSI) can now be signed via
  SignPath Foundation (free OV-level Authenticode for open source)
  through the official `signpath/github-action-submit-signing-request`
  action (pinned `c92b9587`, v2.3) instead of a locally held PFX: the
  unsigned files are uploaded as a GitHub artifact, signed in SignPath's
  HSM (the certificate never leaves the vault) and downloaded back into
  staging. `build-package.yml` gates the path on all four `SIGNPATH_*`
  secrets, gives it precedence over the PFX path (mutually exclusive) and
  adds `actions: read` for the artifact download; `scripts/check-beta-gate.py`
  criterion 4 now accepts **either** the PFX pair **or** the SignPath set
  for Windows (`missing_signing_secrets` / `windows_signing_satisfied`);
  new `scripts/test-signpath-config.py` validates the wiring (secrets,
  pin, upload → submit → copy-back round trips, precedence, wait flag)
  with 5 self-test cases; `docs/code-signing.md` gains the SignPath
  section with the honest hash-vs-file-based distinction (hash-based
  signing is a paid Code Signing Gateway feature); README updated
- feat(signing): Linux GPG signing + maintainer setup doc (issue #50) — the
  release pipeline now signs the Linux AppImage with a detached GPG signature
  (`rivulet-linux-x86_64.AppImage.asc`) when `LINUX_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` is
  configured (`packaging/linux/sign-gpg.sh`: armored or base64 key import,
  optional `LINUX_GPG_PASSPHRASE`, throwaway keyring, detached ASCII-armored
  output); `build-package.yml` gates it on a new `linux_enabled` check and
  uploads the `.asc` next to the AppImage; `signing-e2e.yml` gains a Linux job
  that smoke-tests the full loop with a throwaway Ed25519 key (armored + base64
  import, verify, missing-key abort) via `packaging/linux/test-gpg-signing.sh`;
  new `docs/code-signing.md` maintainer guide covers all three platforms
  (Windows PFX export, macOS p12 + notarization credentials, Linux GPG key
  creation), verification, and troubleshooting; README code-signing section
  gains the Linux secret list and links the doc; ci_pinning guard
  `code_signing_automation_is_wired_up` pins secrets, scripts, e2e job, doc
  contents and README link so a signing regression fails CI
- docs(vst3): Z96-4 hosting contract, platform matrix, and gating — `docs/vst3.md` gains the binding Z96-4 section documenting what the `vst3` module does today (config/discovery/probe, host contract, Windows COM skeleton, skip-path tests), what it explicitly does **NOT** include (no full plugin stack/process call, no per-track GUI panel, no macOS/Linux host, no Qt UI plugins), the platform matrix with honest status per platform, and the CI gating rules (pinning guard `vst3_host_boundary_and_skeleton_are_wired`, Z96-3 skip-path semantics); `docs/vst3-host-boundary.md` platform matrix updated from "Next subtask" to the shipped state with the gating note; README M5 VST3 bullet rewritten to state contract + skeleton shipped with audio routing open and links to both docs; platform feature matrix row updated; ci_pinning guard extended to pin all Z96-4 doc markers. Closes the last open subtask of issue #96 (M5) — `check-user-guide-freshness.py` now derives feature topics **automatically from the GUI i18n keys**: every `.tr()`/`.tr_fmt()` key is grouped by its first-underscore prefix, and any prefix with ≥5 distinct keys (`MIN_KEYS_PER_TOPIC`) becomes a required topic unless listed in `GENERIC_PREFIXES`; `LABEL_OVERRIDES` fixes awkward labels (obs→obs-websocket, autoclip→Auto-Clip, ndi→NDI, vf→Video), `TOPIC_ALIASES` accepts localized spellings (Composition ↔ Quellen/Sources); a new GUI feature with its own key namespace extends the doc check with **no script edit** — the derivation immediately caught the undocumented 'Composition' topic (22 distinct keys) and the guide now covers it under its section 5 heading alias; `REQUIRED_TOPICS` stays as the explicit floor; extended self-test (derivation, generics filtered, alias accepted, missing-derived-topic fails), ci_pinning guard extended, `docs/wiki-translation-workflow.md` updated
- feat(docs): doc-freshness enforcement for wiki and user manual — `scripts/check-user-guide-freshness.py` derives the navigation surface from the GUI's `AppView` enum and fails CI when `docs/user-guide.md` misses a view or a shipped feature topic (Multistream, Auto-Clip, MIDI, Discord, obs-websocket, Sprache, Replay, Hotkeys); the user guide was updated to document Restream, Chat (Twitch/Kick/YouTube with send + budget), Auto-Clips, Discord Rich Presence, MIDI (incl. Learn-Mode/presets) and obs-websocket control; `check-wiki-translations.py` gains a configurable locale list (`--locales`, default `de`, EN canonical) so future languages extend checking without script changes; `audit-wiki-links.py` gains a staleness report (`--stale`, optional `--strict`) comparing repo-doc mirrors against their wiki pages' last-modified dates; the wiki job now also runs on every PR touching `docs/`, README or CONTRIBUTING (not only weekly); self-tests for both scripts, ci_pinning guard `docs_freshness_is_ci_enforced`, `docs/wiki-translation-workflow.md` extended
- feat(vst3): VST3 host-boundary skip-path tests (Z96-3) — 8 new tests covering every `SkipReason` variant (BundleNotFound/BundleInvalid/NoFactory/NoProcessor/HostError) through mock hosts, verifying that skipped plugins never load into the active process, the chain always produces one result per plugin even when all are skipped, partial-skip chains preserve loaded/skipped separation, and chain validation remains independent of load results. Tests are deterministic (no plugin binary required) and designed so real plugin binaries can be added later without removing the test-only boundary tests
- feat(vst3): Windows VST3 COM host skeleton (Z96-2) — `WindowsVstHost` struct with `resolve_bundle_path()` (absolute path passthrough + search-directory fallback for relative paths), `load_library()` (LoadLibraryW via `windows-sys 0.59` with null-handle guard), and `VstHost` impl dispatching through the four stages (BundleResolve → FactoryObtain → ProcessorCreate → Loaded); non-Windows stubs return `Skipped` for all plugins; auto-discovers `.vst3` bundles in `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3` and user directories; 14 unit tests (bundle resolution, library loading, discovery, error paths)
- feat(vst3): VST3 host runtime boundary (Z96-1) — `VstHost` trait with `load_plugin()` → `HostLoadResult` (Loaded/Skipped), `SkipReason` enum (BundleNotFound/BundleInvalid/NoFactory/NoProcessor/HostError), `HostHandle` opaque identity, `ChainLoadResults` summary type, `load_chain()` helper; skip-on-error pattern mirrors `SkippedFilter` (never fatal); `VstChain` remains validatable after load; 8 unit tests with mock hosts (success/skip/mixed/empty chain), `docs/vst3-host-boundary.md`
- feat(autoclip): chat-driven auto-clips (M6) — `SpikeDetector` with sliding-window message-rate threshold, configurable cooldown, and customizable `!clip` command parser; `AutoClipConfig` with validation; auto-clip toggle and settings (threshold, window, cooldown, command) in the Stream view; 16 unit tests, ci_pinning guard, 10 new i18n keys (EN/DE), README M6 updated
- feat(restream): multi-platform restream (M6) — add/remove restream targets in the Stream view with per-platform name, platform selector (Twitch/YouTube/Kick/Custom), ingest URL, and stream key; targets are persisted in app state, wired into `MultistreamSettings` before every stream start via `apply_restream_targets()`, independent health per target via the existing `StreamTargetState` telemetry; max 4 targets with duplicate-name protection, i18n (EN/DE, 14 new keys), 4 GUI unit tests, ci_pinning guard, README + platform feature matrix updated
- feat(i18n): complete multi-language support (M5) — wired all remaining hardcoded GUI strings through locale keys (461 keys EN/DE), added OS locale auto-detection on first launch (`LC_MESSAGES`/`LANG` env vars), added `all_keys_present_in_all_locales` parity test that fails CI if any key drifts between locales, created `docs/i18n.md` architecture doc, updated README M5 checklist and platform feature matrix. EQ band labels ("System"/"Mic") now translate correctly
- feat(gui): source delete hotkey (M5 OBS 32.2 parity) — the selected composition source/scene item can be deleted via the `delete_source` action in the existing hotkey registry, rebindable in Settings → Hotkeys with a `Delete` default (`key_name`/`vk_code` gained the Delete mapping; legacy persisted hotkey configs migrate to `Delete` instead of the placeholder binding via the new serde default). The shared dispatch (`dispatch_hotkey_action`) and the in-app focused-window path both route to `delete_selected_composition_source`, which respects the scene-local lock (locked sources are kept, localized status), clears the selection after removal, and works against the active scene (Studio Mode Preview when enabled). Scope is deliberately honest and documented: destructive and repeat-sensitive, `delete_source` is **in-app only** — never registered as a Windows OS-level global hotkey (would fire while the user types Delete in another app, unlike OBS where remove is also app-local) and never fires while a text field is focused (shares the `!wants_keyboard_input` guard so Delete keeps editing rename/chat input). A visible "Delete source" button was added to the Scenes composition panel next to Lower/Raise/Duplicate for discoverability. New EN+DE i18n keys (`hotkey_delete_source`, `composition_delete_source`, `composition_delete_hint`, `composition_source_locked`, `composition_source_deleted`); the Hotkeys hint updated to state the destructive-in-app scope. Tests: defaults/rebinding, serde round-trip + legacy migration, deliberate absence from `current_global_bindings`, deterministic action-dispatch (delete, lock guard, no scene/selection), and a source-contract pin that the in-app dispatch lives inside the text-input guard. New ci_pinning guard `m5_source_delete_hotkey_is_wired_and_pinned` ties README (checked), `docs/obs-vision-roadmap.md` (**Done**), `docs/hotkeys.md` (action table + in-app-only scope + matrix note) and the GUI wiring together so a silent regression fails CI. README M5 bullet and `docs/platform-feature-matrix.md` hotkeys row updated

- fix(security): resolve the 11 open code-scanning alerts — **#79/#80
  (DangerousWorkflowID, critical):** `.github/workflows/release.yml` checked
  out `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha` in a `workflow_run`-triggered
  workflow with `contents: write` ("untrusted code checkout"); a fork whose PR
  source branch is named `develop` passes the `branches: [develop]` filter and
  the release job would execute fork code with the repository token/secrets
  (pwn request). Both release jobs now check out the protected default branch
  by default (no event `ref`, fully reviewed code) and are gated on the
  triggering run's repository ownership
  (`head_repository.full_name == github.repository`, with the
  `workflow_dispatch` escape), so a foreign fork's CI completion can never
  start a release. **#70–#78 (rust/hard-coded-cryptographic-value):** all nine
  were deterministic OBS auth handshake test vectors (scripted
  password/salt/challenge feeding `compute_secret`/`compute_auth_response` in
  `rivulet-obs-websocket`), confined to `#[cfg(test)]` modules and integration
  tests — dismissed with the canonical `used in tests` reason. New ci_pinning
  guard `code_scanning_alerts_are_resolved_and_pinned` asserts release.yml
  never restores the event-head checkout and carries the ownership guards, and
  that `docs/security.md` keeps documenting the dismissal policy (new
  "Code scanning alert management" section)
- build(ci): prepare the Windows GStreamer provisioning for the 1.28 installer generation — the 1.28 series replaced the classic runtime+devel MSI pair with ONE unified Inno Setup `.exe` installer (cerbero), which the previous inline CI install logic could not handle. All three Windows paths (`ci.yml`, `build-package.yml`, `nightly.yml`) now install through the new shared helper `packaging/windows/install-gstreamer.ps1`, which auto-detects the generation (MSI pair ≤ 1.26 vs. unified `.exe` ≥ 1.28), downloads via cache → mirrored release → freedesktop.org with SHA256 verification against the official `.sha256sum` sidecar (the 1.28 installers are NOT Authenticode-signed), installs silently (`msiexec /qn` or `/VERYSILENT /TYPE=devel /DIR=` with a `/PORTABLE=1` retry for non-elevated hosts) into the fixed `C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64`, and exports the identical env contract as before. The 1.28 path was fully verified locally: SHA256-matched `1.28.6` installer, silent admin install (~3.5 min), 542 plugin DLLs incl. x264/libav/flv, pkg-config resolves 1.28.6, `cargo check -p rivulet-core` green against the 1.28.6 headers (gstreamer-rs 0.25.3 unchanged). `mirror-gstreamer-msi.sh` now auto-detects the `.exe` generation so future 1.28.x versions can be mirrored unchanged; the current pin stays 1.26.11 (the MSI-era head) — moving to 1.28.x is now a one-line pin change plus a mirror run, see the new `docs/gstreamer-ci.md`; ci_pinning guard extended to pin the helper contract
- build(deps): upgrade the Windows CI GStreamer runtime 1.24.13 → 1.26.11 — 1.24 has reached EOL and 1.24.13 dates from June 2025; 1.26.11 (March 2026) is the current, supported head of the 1.26 series, which is the newest release still shipping classic per-component MSIs that CI installs silently (`msiexec /qn`). The 1.28 series replaced the MSIs with a unified cerbero `.exe` installer, which needs its own install step before it can be adopted (mirroring 1.28.6 was attempted first and rejected for exactly this reason). Both MSIs (runtime 88 MB, devel 352 MB) were mirrored to the `gstreamer-msi-1.26.11` release so CI keeps the mirror-first download strategy with freedesktop.org fallback; version pins bumped in `ci.yml`, `build-package.yml`, `nightly.yml` and the `mirror-gstreamer-msi.sh` default, cache keys re-keyed to `gstreamer-msvc-1.26.11` so stale 1.24 caches cannot be restored. The Rust bindings (gstreamer-rs 0.25.3) are already current and stay on the API/ABI-stable 1.x contract. New ci_pinning guard `windows_ci_installs_one_consistent_gstreamer_version` enforces that all Windows CI paths pin the same version, the mirror-first strategy stays intact and no EOL 1.24.13 reference returns; the 28 pipeline-string tests plus the full 3-platform matrix are the behavioral safety net for pad-linking differences (the flvmux hardening from PR #105 was a 1.24-specific parser behavior)
- fix(release): audit all softprops `files:` lists and fix the two remaining upload-overlap issues — (1) the tag-based beta/rc/stable release path in `ci.yml` still named `release-assets/SHA256SUMS` explicitly IN ADDITION to the `release-assets/*` glob, the exact double-upload that failed alpha.138 (`Not Found` on update-a-release-asset, manifest missing); the duplicate is removed and the glob-only contract documented in the workflow; (2) the Linux and macOS build jobs both uploaded a bare binary named `rivulet-gui`, and the release job's `actions/download-artifact` (`merge-multiple: true`) collapses same-named files from different artifacts into ONE file — the live alpha.138 SHA256SUMS listed `rivulet-gui` exactly once, so one platform's bare binary silently vanished. Both stage steps now create platform-qualified upload copies (`rivulet-linux-x86_64-gui`, `rivulet-macos-aarch64-gui`); packaging continues to read the shared `staging/rivulet-gui`. ci_pinning guards extended: `updater_verifies_release_checksums_before_install` now also enforces the glob-only SHA256SUMS attachment on the tag path, and the new `build_package_artifacts_have_platform_unique_basenames` guard pins the unique-basename contract
- docs(m6): add the Multi-Track Audio Routing feature spec (record/stream) — new `docs/m6-audio-routing.md` under the M6 Creator Toolkit: named per-app audio sources (Game, Spotify, Discord, ...) with per-source filter chains, volume and mute, a record/stream routing matrix (checkbox per source × output), persistence across restarts, and per-platform capture (WASAPI per-app on Windows, PipeWire/PulseAudio per-app on Linux, system-loopback fallback on macOS); engine additions are sketched (`AudioSource`, `AudioRouting`, `AudioFilterChain`, source-management API, per-source GStreamer filter chains with a routing tee into record/stream muxes, FLV single-track mix for streaming) with backward compatibility for the legacy System/Microphone pair and `push_audio_track`; GUI adds per-source mixer rows plus inline mixers in the Record and Stream views (single control implementation, three placements) that also close the M5 macOS mixer gap; new EN+DE i18n keys listed; M6-specific quality-gate checks defined (persist round-trip, routing separation test, zero-source warning, macOS fallback behaviour, 5+-source resource budget, i18n parity guard); out of scope: VST3 hosting, cloud remote routing, MIDI switching, ASIO. README M6 roadmap bullet, the M6 quality gate in `docs/milestone-quality-gates.md`, and the new ci_pinning guard `m6_audio_routing_is_specified_in_readme_gate_and_spec` pin the spec so the three cannot drift
- docs(m5): close the two remaining M5 Platform Parity gate gaps — new `docs/platform-feature-matrix.md` documents Windows/macOS/Linux feature parity (screen/window/region capture, game capture, audio incl. filters, recording pipeline, streaming, hotkeys, installers/update, i18n, accessibility, verification) with platform-specific limitations explicitly labelled (macOS: no game-capture hooks, no region picker, no audio filters/volume sliders/monitoring yet, compile-only CI; Linux: portal/PipeWire/X11 requirements and no Windows-style hooks); `docs/obs-websocket.md` gains a "Compatibility / risk boundary (M5 gate)" section marking the OBS WebSocket server as a protocol-compatible surface rather than an OBS Studio equivalent (127.0.0.1-only bind, optional auth, out-of-scope requests → `UnknownRequestType`, Rivulet-owned state); README and the M5 exit evidence in `docs/milestone-quality-gates.md` now link the matrix, and the new ci_pinning guard `m5_platform_parity_evidence_is_linked_and_pinned` pins both evidences so they cannot drift
- fix(release): attach SHA256SUMS exactly once — the alpha.138 release job failed after most uploads with `Not Found` on "update-a-release-asset": the softprops `files:` list named `release-assets/SHA256SUMS` explicitly IN ADDITION to the `release-assets/*` glob, so the same asset was uploaded twice concurrently; one upload won, the duplicate update request 404'd, and the release was left without the manifest the updater requires (every other asset incl. MSI/DMG/AppImage landed fine). The duplicate line is removed (the glob covers the manifest, the OSPS comment even documents that); a failed job rerun republishes the missing SHA256SUMS; ci_pinning guard `updater_verifies_release_checksums_before_install` extended to fail on a duplicate files: entry so the double-upload cannot regress
- fix(ci): pin the assets-image build to a Debian snapshot — the 404 persisted even with `No-Cache=true`: the `deb.debian.org` Fastly edge itself serves a stale Release index intermittently (same SHA passed on the PR runner while the push runner hit a bad edge), so no client-side cache knob can fix it deterministically. The build now points apt at `snapshot.debian.org` pinned to `20250901T000000Z` (immutable archive where index and pool are always consistent), dropping the base image's distro sources; verified locally (snapshot build green, offline asset run byte-identical) and the CI history confirms snapshot-pinned builds are immune to this class of skew
- fix(ci): force fresh apt index in the assets-image build — the push-run failure finally surfaced the real root cause (build-time output is no longer swallowed): apt 404'd on `libperl5.32_5.32.1-4+deb11u5_amd64.deb` from `debian-security`, the classic Debian CDN index/pool skew — the pinned Bullseye base image's cached package index is stale relative to the CDN edge serving the pool, so `apt-get install` fetched the old index (listing deb11u5) while the pool already moved on. `Acquire::http::No-Cache=true` forces the index to be fetched fresh from the origin on every build (plus `Acquire::Retries=5` for transient transport errors), so the listed and available package versions always match
- fix(ci): bake python3+git into the assets-check image at build time — `--network host` was not enough: the pull_request CI run still failed every attempt in ~2.5 s with no container output while the identical push run passed on a different runner, i.e. network-at-run-time inside the container is fundamentally unreliable on GitHub runners (default-bridge DNS blackhole, transparently kept by some runner images). The step now writes a two-line Dockerfile FROM the pinned `dpokidov/imagemagick:7.1.2-12` digest, bakes `python3` + `git` in ONCE via `docker build --network host` (host DNS, 3 attempts, cached layers make retries cheap), and the runtime container then executes generation + pixel comparison fully offline — no network, no flakes, by construction. Verified end-to-end locally (build green, offline run regenerates all 8 assets byte-identical, "All assets match the committed files"); ci_pinning guard updated to pin the build-time bake and offline runtime
- fix(ci): run the Lints assets container with --network host — after the retry wrapper landed, the pull_request CI run still failed all 3 attempts in ~2.5 s each while the identical push run passed on a different runner: the default Docker bridge on GitHub runners frequently has broken DNS while the host resolves fine, so apt inside the container cannot reach the archive no matter how often it retries. The container now shares the host network (`--network host`, mount and entrypoint behavior unchanged); locally verified that the exact command still regenerates all 8 assets byte-identical ("All assets match the committed files"); ci_pinning guard extended to pin the flag so it cannot be dropped again
- fix(ci): make the Lints assets check resilient to runner network flakes — the "Check generated assets are up to date" step runs the pinned ImageMagick container (`dpokidov/imagemagick:7.1.2-12` by digest), whose inner `apt-get update` needs the network on every fresh pull; transient runner/registry network failures made it exit 100 with no output, repeatedly failing the Lints job on ubuntu-latest (observed on PR #105). The step now retries the container run up to 3 times with a 10 s pause and gives apt its own retry/timeout knobs (`Acquire::Retries=3`, `Acquire::http::Timeout=20`), so a network blip cannot fail the job; verified locally that the pinned image regenerates all 8 assets byte-identical ("All assets match the committed files"). New ci_pinning guard `lints_assets_step_retries_the_pinned_container` pins the retry wrapper and the pinned image reference
- fix(ci): provision the statement-coverage job with the GStreamer runtime plugins — the coverage job installed only the *dev* headers (`libgstreamer1.0-dev`, `libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev`), which pull in gst-plugins-base but no x264enc/flvmux/mp4mux/avenc_aac factories; the gate runs the real pipeline and end-to-end recording tests under llvm-cov, so those 18 tests panicked on missing factories ("software encoder unavailable", "pipeline must parse") even though the identical code passed the regular test job and a fully provisioned local repro (88.42 % coverage, zero failures). The job now installs the same runtime plugin packages as the test job (`gstreamer1.0-plugins-{base,good,bad,ugly}`, `gstreamer1.0-libav`, `gstreamer1.0-tools`); ci_pinning guard `ossf_silver_gap_closures_are_pinned` extended to assert the coverage job carries every runtime plugin package, so a future provisioning drift fails CI
- fix(ci): make the statement-coverage gate green under llvm-cov instrumentation (PR #105 coverage job, 18 failures on Ubuntu) — the session pipeline strings that feed an FLV muxer (streaming and dual output) now put an explicit `h264parse` right after the video encoder and link through the muxer's *named* request pads (`mux.video`/`mux.audio`) instead of any-pad `! mux.` links: on GStreamer <= 1.24 (stock Ubuntu) the parser could not infer the caps of a branch starting from a byte-stream H.264 encoder (notably NVENC) through a `tee`/`queue`, so `gst::parse::launch` failed with `could not link … to mux` — meaning Ubuntu users could not start a stream, not just a test issue. `h264parse` exposes a `video/x-h264` src template covering both stream formats and performs the byte-stream → AVC conversion FLV/mp4 require. Recording/container paths keep their muxer any-pad links (verified green there). New `video_mux_leg`/`audio_mux_leg`/`h264_parse_fragment` helpers; all 28 pipeline-string tests + the full 663-test suite verified green on Ubuntu 24.04 / GStreamer 1.24.2 (WSL strict repro) before and 88.42 % statement coverage under real `cargo llvm-cov` instrumentation with the gate's serialized run
- fix(ci): harden `scripts/coverage-gate.sh` — the gate used to pipe the run through `tail -n 15`, which discarded the very failure details CI needed to diagnose a red run (the first coverage run failed 18 tests but the log showed only the summary line). It now keeps the full log in a temp file and prints a `coverage failure details` group (failures, panics, test results, TOTAL) on failure, and runs the suite serially by default (`RUST_TEST_THREADS=1`): GStreamer request-pad linking and the plugin registry are exercised by many tests in parallel, and under llvm-cov instrumentation that contention made parses fail sporadically and starved real-time pipeline tests of CPU. Verified: the previously red coverage job passes locally under identical conditions (Ubuntu 1.24.2, rustc 1.98.0, llvm-cov, serial)
- fix(gui): keep the monitor when picking a window and scope the window list to it — the Window dropdown now lists only the windows of the selected monitor (Windows: `Window::monitor` + `Monitor::index`; Linux/macOS: `xcap::Window::current_monitor`, matched via monitor id/rect), so switching monitors actually changes the offered windows, and selecting a window no longer clears the monitor: the Source dropdown keeps showing the monitor instead of jumping to "Select Monitor". Because both can be selected at once now, the capture source resolves window-before-monitor on Windows and macOS (Linux already did) and the live preview shows the window for the same reason. Platform variants share the new pure, unit-tested `keep_on_selected_monitor` (index-preserving filter; no monitor selected → all windows); docs/user-guide.md updated
- feat(ossf): close the remaining silver-tier repo-side gaps — **coverage gate**: new `scripts/coverage-gate.sh` measures `rivulet-core` statement coverage with `cargo-llvm-cov` and fails CI below 80 % (new `Statement Coverage (rivulet-core >= 80%)` job in ci.yml, wired into the CI aggregator; scope = core library because the platform hook/launcher shims are not headless-testable); **assurance case**: new `docs/security/assurance-case.md` argues the security requirements (threat model, trust boundaries, secure-design argument, common-weaknesses countermeasures incl. fuzzing, secret redaction, fail-closed updates, memory safety); **access continuity**: GOVERNANCE.md gains an `## Access continuity (bus factor)` plan (backup-maintainer onboarding, private credential-contingency procedure, one-week recovery window) that states the current single-maintainer status honestly; **debug info**: Cargo.toml release profile documents that debug info is deliberately preserved (no strip / install -s, RUSTFLAGS `-C debuginfo` passes through). ci_pinning guard `ossf_silver_gap_closures_are_pinned` extended to pin all four; docs/openssf-best-practices.md updated
- docs(ossf): close the OpenSSF silver-tier repo-side gaps — **governance/roles**: new `GOVERNANCE.md` documents the governance model, the Maintainer/Contributor/Reviewer/User roles, decision-making, release process, succession and bus-factor handling; **code of conduct**: new `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1) at the repo root, the standard location GitHub surfaces; **achievements**: the README front page gains a `🏆 Achievements` section hyperlinking the OpenSSF Best Practices badge (`bestpractices.dev/projects/14447`, Baseline-1 + metal Passing at 100 %) plus the license and the community-rule documents; **DCO**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the Developer Certificate of Origin (with the `developercertificate.org` link) and the new `scripts/check-dco.py` verifies every commit in a range carries a `Signed-off-by` trailer matching its author — wired into CI as the `DCO (Signed-off-by)` job in ci.yml (full-history checkout, runs on pull_request) and into the local pre-push hook (skipped when no `origin/develop` ref exists, CI enforces on PRs), with a `--self-test`; **regression tests**: new `docs/regression-testing.md` formalizes the policy (every bug fix ships a regression test that fails on the unfixed code; named exceptions only) and the tracking mechanism (`regression-tested` label + commit trail) as the answer to silver criterion `regression_tests_added50`; the Definition of Done in CONTRIBUTING.md and the new `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (Definition-of-Done checklist incl. regression test + DCO) encode both. New ci_pinning guard `ossf_silver_gap_closures_are_pinned` pins all five closures and the evidence map
- ci(security): per-PR Ruleset Guard continuously proves the develop ruleset blocks direct pushes — new `.github/workflows/ruleset-guard.yml` runs on every pull request, after every push to `develop`, weekly, and on demand, executing `scripts/check-develop-ruleset.py`, which reads the live rulesets API (read-only, Metadata permission, anonymous-capable for the public repo, so fork-PR-safe) and asserts the `develop` ruleset is `active`, covers `refs/heads/develop`, lists **no bypass actors**, and keeps the `deletion`/`non_fast_forward`/`pull_request` (automated-review, approval count 0)/`required_status_checks` rules with the merge-gate contexts. An actual push probe is deliberately avoided (it would land on develop exactly when the ruleset is broken; `git push --dry-run` never reaches server-side ruleset evaluation). Checker ships an offline `--self-test`; ci_pinning guard `develop_ruleset_guard_proves_direct_pushes_are_blocked` pins the workflow triggers/permissions and the checker invariants; docs/security.md documents the guard and its local invocation
- ci(ossf): extend .bestpractices.json to the metal-series passing level — alongside the 24/24 baseline-1 controls, the file now proposes Met for the 30 passing criteria the repo demonstrably meets and a file can vouch for (contribution + contribution_requirements, floss_license, license_location, documentation_basics, sites_https, discussion, english, repo_public/track/interim, version_unique, release_notes, report_process/tracker/archive, vulnerability_report_process/private, build, test, test_invocation, test_policy, warnings, warnings_fixed, static_analysis, no_leaked_credentials, delivery_mitm, dynamic_analysis, description_good, interact), each with repo evidence and URLs where the criterion requires one; behavioural criteria (maintained, report_responses, know_secure_design, crypto_*, vulnerabilities_fixed_60_days) stay unclaimed for the online questionnaire. ci_pinning extended: the schema guard accepts the full canonical metal-passing key set (new `METAL_PASSING_CRITERIA` const from criteria/criteria.yml) and the new `bestpractices_metal_passing_claims_are_pinned` guard keeps the claimed set exactly in sync with the file; docs/openssf-best-practices.md updated
- ci(ossf): close the three OpenSSF baseline-1 gaps and propose all 24 controls as Met — (1) **osps_ac_03_01**: the live `develop` ruleset (id 8577978) now lists **no bypass actors** (the `RepositoryRole` administrator always-bypass is removed) and drops `required_approving_review_count` to 0, so direct commits to `develop` are rejected for every actor and all changes land as pull requests whose required status checks gate the merge (automated checks are the review in the single-maintainer case); CONTRIBUTING.md Code Review Policy and docs/security.md rewritten accordingly. (2) **osps_le_03_02**: both release paths (release.yml alpha, ci.yml beta/RC/stable tags) copy `LICENSE` into `release-assets/` before generating `SHA256SUMS`, so the MIT license ships with every release and is covered by the checksum manifest. (3) **osps_qa_04_01**: the README gains a `## 📚 Repositories` section listing the primary `thoser666/Rivulet` codebase and the `Rivulet.wiki` docs companion with status and intent. `.bestpractices.json` now claims all 24 baseline-1 controls as Met with evidence (comment updated); ci_pinning extended: the schema guard requires a status key for every canonical control (complete coverage) and the new `ossf_baseline_1_gap_closures_are_pinned` guard pins the three closures (file claims, README repo list, LICENSE-copy step in both workflows, no-bypass wording in CONTRIBUTING/docs/security.md); docs/openssf-best-practices.md updated
- ci(pinning): guard `bestpractices_json_claims_are_schema_valid_and_canonical` validates the OpenSSF badge automation-proposal draft — `.bestpractices.json` (repo root, now committed) must parse as JSON, may only use canonical baseline-1 criterion keys (24-control list pinned in the test, OSPS v2026.08.28) with legal status values (`Met`/`Unmet`/`N/A`/`?`/`unknown`, case-insensitive), every concrete claim needs a non-empty justification, and justifications must pair with their status; because the badge site silently ignores unknown keys and invalid statuses, this makes schema mistakes fail CI instead of silently dropping claims. serde_json added as a rivulet-core dev-dependency (already locked via the workspace). docs/openssf-best-practices.md gains an Automation-proposals section referencing the file and lists the guard under "How this page stays true"
- docs(contribution): close the OpenSSF Best Practices passing-badge repo-side gaps — CONTRIBUTING.md gains a **Code Review Policy** (PR-based review for contributors, exception-only maintainer direct pushes that must pass the pre-push hook + CI, mandatory PR review for workflow/packaging/signing/security changes, automated checks treated as reviewers) and a **Definition of Done (Acceptable Contributions)** section (tests for new functionality as the formal test policy, EN+DE i18n parity, documentation + CHANGELOG updates, green fmt/clippy/tests, Conventional Commits, CVE/GHSA/RUSTSEC identifiers on `fix(security):` commits, no-secrets rule); the Release Strategy gains a **Release Verification** subsection that names the `release_notes`/`release_notes_vulns`/`delivery_mitm` criteria and how each is met (build from the CI-tested SHA, completeness-checked generated notes, fixed-vulnerability identification, `SHA256SUMS` + HTTPS, beta-gate). New `docs/openssf-best-practices.md` maps the criteria to repo evidence and what remains a maintainer action on bestpractices.dev; ci_pinning guard `contributing_defines_code_review_policy_and_definition_of_done` pins all three sections and the evidence map
- feat(streaming): NDI output as a selectable destination (M5 #77) — the engine now embeds the `ndisink` feed into every session pipeline: recording/streaming fan the encoded H.264 video through a pre-mux tee (`ndi_vtee`) into `queue ! h264parse ! ndisink`, dual output attaches the feed as an extra `video_tee` output, and the replay buffer and NDI share the same tee when both are enabled. New `RivuletEngine::set_ndi_output`/`ndi_output` (validated, inactive-by-default, invalid names rejected without mutation) and a Settings → “NDI output (LAN)” section (enable/name/optional group, localized EN+DE, empty-name and missing-plugin warnings) that is applied before every recording and streaming start; `NdiOutput::should_publish` reports whether the NewTek `ndi` plugin is installed. Core pipeline tests (present-by-mode, absent when inactive/default, coexistence with replay, setter validation) + GUI behavior/source-contract tests + ci_pinning guard `ndi_output_is_wired_into_the_engine_and_gui`; README parity row and docs/ndi.md updated — audio-in-NDI, a standalone NDI-only session, and live LAN verification (needs the NewTek runtime) remain follow-ups
- fix(ci): qualify the alpha release-branch push destination — `scripts/release-branch.sh` (and its test fixture) now push `HEAD` to the fully-qualified `refs/heads/<branch>` destination instead of the shorthand `HEAD:<branch>`; newer git versions reject the unqualified form when the source is HEAD ("The destination you provided is not a full refname", observed on the workflow_run-gated release where the version job failed exactly there after CI went green). All three reconcile paths (new branch, fast-forward, force-with-lease overwrite) use the qualified destination; `scripts/test-release-branch.sh` re-runs green locally and the ci_pinning guard was updated to pin the qualified form and reject the old shorthand
- feat(ci): the weekly OBS upstream check now also sweeps Rivulet's own open issues — feature wishes (`feature`/`idea`/`wish` label or feature-reading title; PRs, `bug` reports, and housekeeping excluded) are scored with the same `scripts/vision-criteria.json` and merged into one common review report under a `## Rivulet open issues` section with advisory decisions, an “Already represented” list for catalog-covered wishes (title-only, distinctive terms so generic words like “streaming”/“scenes” cannot mislabel bug reports), and a new `docs/community-wish-candidates.md` review queue for strong-fit wishes (generated between COMMUNITY-WISH-CANDIDATES markers, uploaded as artifact). Roadmap-tracked milestone work (`enhancement`/`epic`) is listed in a separate “Roadmap-tracked” section instead of being re-triaged weekly; the eight open issues were relabelled accordingly and a new `feature` label was created. Instead of living only in the run artifact, the merged report is published as a labeled `weekly-vision-review` GitHub issue (one per week, title carries date + OBS tag) whose body appends a **review checklist** — every OBS candidate and community wish awaiting a decision becomes an unchecked `- [ ]` box; reruns of the same week update that issue, a new week closes older ones so exactly one stays open. The workflow gains `issues: write`, the empty-report guard now requires both section headers, and offline runs can pass `--issues-file` or `--no-issues`. Self-test extended (vision decisions, covered/strong buckets, doc marker round-trip); ci_pinning guard `obs_upstream_weekly_check_also_reviews_rivulet_open_issues`; docs/obs-upstream-check.md updated
- fix(gui): streaming stop is non-blocking and cannot leak a session — the Stream-workspace button and OBS StopStreaming previously only cleared the stream config: a pure-stream session stayed active in the engine (is_recording stuck, silently blocking the next recording/stream start) and any engine stop ran synchronously. Both paths now go through the new `stop_streaming_session()`: a pure-stream session (nothing else running) ends the engine session via the same background teardown as recording stops — with the visible “Finalizing… → Recording saved.” status — while a dual session (recording still active) only drops the stream config and keeps the recording running, since the engine cannot reconfigure a live dual-output pipeline. New engine getter `RivuletEngine::is_recording()`; GUI tests `stopping_a_pure_stream_session_ends_it_in_the_background` and `stopping_the_stream_keeps_a_dual_recording_session_alive`; docs/stream-setup.md updated
- feat(gui): visible stop finalization status — `stop_recording_background` now returns a completion handle that fires when the background teardown (EOS finalization, auto-remux, cloud upload) finished, and the GUI shows “Finalizing recording…” under the record controls while it runs, flipping to “Recording saved.” the moment it completes (i18n recording_finalizing/recording_saved, EN+DE); the record_status field is now cross-platform (rendered in the Windows record view too, previously Linux-only), the per-frame `poll_stop_finalization` flips the status and keeps repainting until done, error/abort paths cancel the pending flip so “Recording saved.” never overwrites a failure reason, and engine-internal push-error stops now also use the background teardown; new GUI behavior test `background_stop_shows_finalizing_status_until_saved`, source-contract guard updated, docs/recording-formats.md updated
- fix(gui): recording stop no longer freezes the UI — `stop_recording` used to run the whole GStreamer teardown synchronously on the caller's thread (EOS push, up-to-10 s wait for the muxer to finalize the file, pipeline → Null) and then the optional auto-remux and S3 cloud upload inline, so clicking “Stop” while recording left the interface unresponsive for the whole duration (seconds to minutes for long recordings with remux/upload enabled). The engine now splits stop into a synchronous detach (`detach_stopped_session` — engine state is reset immediately, a new recording/stream can start right away) and a finalize step (`finalize_stopped_session` — EOS wait, teardown, replay clear, auto-remux, cloud upload) that `stop_recording` runs on the caller thread (tests/API contract unchanged) while the new `stop_recording_background` runs on a background thread; the three GUI stop handlers (Windows, Linux, aux camera/game capture) now call the background variant. New core test `background_stop_returns_immediately_and_finalizes_the_file`, new GUI source-contract guard `gui_recording_stop_never_blocks_the_ui_thread_on_teardown`, docs/recording-formats.md + docs/cloud-recordings.md updated
- ci(release): gate the alpha release on CI conclusion — `release.yml` no longer runs on the push itself but is triggered by the CI workflow completing (`workflow_run` on `CI`, `types: [completed]`, branch `develop`) and only proceeds when that run concluded `success`; a failed/cancelled CI run (e.g. a transient runner flake) leaves the release skipped instead of starting a broken build, and rerunning CI green fires the workflow again automatically (the `workflow_run` payload carries `run_attempt`), so flakes no longer require a manual `gh run rerun` on the release. Both the check and version jobs now checkout `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha` (the CI-tested commit) instead of the default-branch tip; the releasable-commit/Dependabot detection reads the same `LAST_TAG..HEAD` range as `scripts/release-version.sh`. Regression: for commit 861b8d5 a rustup download flake failed CI and the parallel release run was left cancelled, requiring a manual rerun. ci_pinning guard `alpha_release_gates_on_ci_conclusion_and_auto_resumes`; CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/release-backfill.md, docs/m3-streaming-quality-gate.md updated
- test(ci): ci_pinning guard `pre_push_hook_is_valid_bash` runs `bash -n` on `.githooks/pre-push`, so a hook with a shell syntax error fails CI instead of being silently unparsed by git on every push; on Windows the check prefers an explicit Git for Windows bash (a PATH `bash` may be the WSL launcher that cannot read Windows paths) and only skips when no Git Bash is installed — CI ubuntu keeps it enforced; CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- ci(hooks): committed local pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`) mirrors the CI Lints job — `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` run before every push once `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` is set (documented in CONTRIBUTING.md); skippable per push via `RIVULET_SKIP_PRE_PUSH=1` or `git push --no-verify`. An optional **fast-guard stage** (default on, toggle `RIVULET_PRE_PUSH_FAST_TESTS=0`) runs the CI pinning tests (`cargo test -p rivulet-core --test ci_pinning`) and the Lints-job script self-tests (`generate-action-pins.py --check`, parity-checklist/release-notes/theme-contrast checks, `generate-release-notes.sh --self-test`) so repo-internal guards pass pre-push. Regression: commit 06792c6 shipped four GUI tests that were clean under plain `cargo clippy` but failed CI's `-D warnings` Lints job (clippy::field_reassign_with_default); the hook uses the exact CI flags so that class of failure happens pre-push. ci_pinning guard `local_pre_push_hook_mirrors_the_ci_lints_job` pins hook + docs markers
- test(ci): harden the chat local-listener fixtures against Windows connection resets — the YouTube worker smoke failed intermittently on windows-latest with `os error 10054` (WSAECONNRESET): the fixture HTTP server answered before fully reading the request, so Windows dropped the socket with a reset instead of a clean FIN. Every local HTTP fixture (YouTube page + `get_live_chat` poll, Kick chatroom-resolution endpoints) now drains headers + `Content-Length` body before responding (`drain_request` / `drain_http_request`), the Twitch IRC fixture documents why line-based reading needs no draining, and the YouTube wait loop got a generous deadline plus fail-fast on `Disconnected`. Verified 20/20 (YouTube), 15/15 (Kick), 15/15 (Twitch) consecutive local runs; docs/twitch-chat.md updated
- feat(gui): send-budget tooltip with platform + window — the budget line above the chat input now reports, on hover, which platform limit applies and over what window (e.g. “Rate limit for Twitch: 20 messages per 30 s”, i18n chat_rate_window), via the new `chat_rate_limit_detail()` helper (remaining, capacity, window_secs, platform label); the wrapper `chat_rate_budget()` stays for tests/status; new GUI behavior test `chat_rate_limit_detail_reports_platform_and_window`, source-contract + ci_pinning guard extended, docs/twitch-chat.md updated (M10 issue #100)
- test(gui): responsive guard for the send-budget indicator — the budget/notice line above the chat input now renders as an explicitly wrapping label (`egui::Label::new(…).wrap()`), so a long (German) notice can never be clipped at the right edge of a narrow dock column regardless of the style's default wrap mode; the Stream view already lives in the page's vertical scroll area (reachable on short windows). Guards extended: ui_smoke `responsive_contract_keeps_controls_reachable_on_narrow_windows` (wrap markers + ordering banner → budget → input), ui_accessibility `narrow_layout_is_responsive`, in-file `stream_workspace_stays_reachable_on_narrow_windows_in_source` and ci_pinning `stream_workspace_controls_stay_reachable_on_narrow_windows`; docs/ui-smoke-testing.md updated
- test(gui): pin the threaded-reply banner — the dock's ✕ cancel affordance now calls a testable `cancel_chat_reply()` helper, covered by a unit test (disarms without enqueueing or touching the draft), and a source-contract test asserts the translated “Replying to <user>” banner (chat_reply_to/chat_reply_cancel, EN+DE) renders above the chat input only while a reply target is armed and keeps its cancel wiring (GUI suite 154 → 156)
- feat(gui): live send-budget indicator above the chat input — the dock reads the running worker's shared rate limiter (`chat_rate_budget()` helper over `rate_limit_remaining()`/`rate_limit_config()`) and shows how many platform messages are still allowed right now (e.g. "Send budget: 17/20 messages"); the line turns warning-colored at ≤ ¼ capacity and is replaced by a translated pause notice while the bucket is empty, so platform throttling is visible before a send is silently dropped; GUI behavior + source-contract tests, ci_pinning guard extended, docs/twitch-chat.md updated (M10 issue #100)
- feat(chat): threaded Twitch replies and phone-verification notice — `ChatMessage` keeps the IRCv3 `id=` tag (Kick/YouTube stay `None`), `TwitchChat::send_reply(text, reply_to_id)` enqueues a `Msg::SendReply` and the worker writes `@reply-parent-msg-id=<id> PRIVMSG #channel :text`; `parse_notice` classifies NOTICE lines and `msg_requires_verified_phone_number` flips `TwitchChat::phone_verification_required()`; the chat facade forwards both (`Chat::send_reply` rate-limited like plain sends and Twitch-only, `Chat::phone_verification_required`); the chat dock gains a per-message ↩ reply affordance with a “Replying to <user>” banner (cancel via ✕) that routes Send to `ChatAction::SendReply`, plus a translated warning when the bot account must be phone-verified; worker unit + local-listener smoke tests (reply wire format, notice → flag), GUI source-contract + behavior tests (reply gates, `submit_chat_input` arms Send vs. SendReply and consumes the reply target), ci_pinning guard `twitch_replies_thread_the_parent_message_id_and_surface_phone_verification`, docs/twitch-chat.md updated (M10 issue #100)
- ci(pinning): guard m10_platform_compliance_bullets_are_pinned_in_docs pins the M10 platform-compliance contract (Twitch scopes/rate limit/PING-PONG/reply-parent-msg-id/phone verification, Kick session-token self-throttling + read-only degradation, YouTube Live API + youtube.force-ssl + parentId + quota ≈200 units/Innertube fallback) in both the README roadmap section and the M10 quality gate, so the two docs cannot silently drift apart or lose a platform
- feat(chat): shared per-platform outbound rate limiter — new rivulet-core::rate_limit token bucket gates every Chat::send_message before it reaches a worker, with documented platform defaults (Twitch 20 msgs/30 s, Kick 10/30 s conservative for the undocumented API, YouTube quota-bounded 1/day) and per-platform override via ChatConfig::rate_limit; Chat exposes rate_limit_config()/rate_limit_remaining() for the UI, the bucket is clock-injectable for deterministic tests, and unit + facade tests cover burst capacity, refill, cap, reset, fractional accumulation and drop-on-exhausted; ci_pinning guard chat_outbound_is_rate_limited_per_platform, docs/twitch-chat.md rate-limiting section (issue #100 first step)
- docs(roadmap): spell out M10 platform-compliance requirements — the README AI Chat Assistant section and the M10 quality gate now list the hard per-platform constraints the bot must satisfy (Twitch 20 msgs/30 s global rate limit + PING/PONG + reply-parent-msg-id + phone-verification hint; Kick self-throttling and read-only degradation for the undocumented API; YouTube Live Streaming API quota accounting for `insert` ≈200 units with Innertube read-only fallback) and the masked auth/scope matrix (chat:read+chat:edit, Kick session token, youtube.force-ssl)
- ci(roadmap): add a Roadmap-Sync Check — scripts/check-roadmap-sync.py validates that the README "Milestone overview" table (contiguous ascending M-numbers, badges), docs/milestone-quality-gates.md (resource table + `### M<n>:` sections from M2) and the live GitHub milestones (titles, badge ids, M-prefix set) stay in sync; the dedicated CI job runs with issues:read and is required by the aggregate, offline --fixture/--self-test modes included, ci_pinning guard roadmap_sync_check_keeps_docs_and_milestones_aligned + docs/roadmap-sync-check.md added; the overview rows for M4/M8/M11 now use the canonical full milestone names
- roadmap: restructure the milestone sequence — a new **M6 – Creator Toolkit & Interactivity** (chat-driven auto-clips, multi-platform restream, mobile/HTTP remote companion) is inserted right after M5, and the former M6–M10 shift to M7–M11 (Automation & Determinism, Embeddable Engine, Modern Architecture, AI Chat Assistant, Extensible UI). GitHub milestones #7–#10 were retitled, new milestones were created (M6, M11), and the overview table, section order, quality-gate document (including a new M6 resource row + gate section), and all cross-references in the README, ui-design, release-platforms, resource-efficiency, extensible-ui-roadmap, obs-vision docs and M2/M3 reports were renumbered consistently; the Scene-item copy/paste row and its candidates entry move from M6 to M7, AI assistant references move from M9 to M10, Extensible UI from M10 to M11, and Modern Architecture/renderer references from M8 to M9. The feature-parity checklist, obs-upstream checker, and release-notes self-tests stay green.
- ci(obs): persist the last-checked OBS release tag across runs — the checker now records the verified tag in a gitignored state file (scripts/.obs-upstream-state.json, atomic temp+rename write) and the weekly OBS workflow restores it from and saves it back to the actions cache (obs-upstream-state-*, same pattern as the fuzz corpus), so the report shows a real "Previous checked release" delta instead of "none" every run; corrupt or missing state degrades to "none" instead of failing, fixture runs never touch the real state, self-test covers the round-trip, ci_pinning guard obs_upstream_check_persists_checked_release_tag_across_runs + docs updated
- ci(obs): fail loudly when the OBS upstream report is empty — the workflow no longer masks check failures with continue-on-error (the "candidate markers missing" case that silently emptied the weekly artifact now fails the run with its traceback) and a new guard inside the check step asserts the report file is non-empty and carries the "## OBS upstream check" header, aborting with an ::error:: annotation otherwise; report/summary/artifact still publish on failure for diagnosis; ci_pinning guard extended, docs updated
- roadmap(obs): review and approve both strong-fit candidates from the 32.2.2 report — frontend-API copy/paste (deterministic + embeddable) is added as the M7 "Scene-item copy/paste API" row and macOS delete-as-hotkey (automation + cross-platform parity) as the M5 "Source delete hotkey" row in docs/obs-vision-roadmap.md; both are new catalog entries (scripts/obs-features.json) with matching README Feature-Parity rows, README M5/M7 checklist items, and the candidates doc now lists them as reviewed/approved
- feat(gui): responsive Stream workspace — below the new STREAM_WORKSPACE_NARROW_WIDTH threshold (720 px) the action bar (platform/preset + start/stop), the stream-config rows, the chat dock (channel/oauth/send) and the Linux audio section wrap with ui.horizontal_wrapped, and the chat/info columns stack instead of clamping into columns(2), so start/stop, connect, send and mixer controls stay reachable in narrow windows (regression: buttons clipped off-screen); the chat send input keeps a minimum width; guards added in ui_smoke.rs, ui_accessibility.rs, an app.rs in-file test and the ci_pinning test stream_workspace_controls_stay_reachable_on_narrow_windows; docs/ui-smoke-testing.md updated
- feat(chat): multi-platform chat dock — besides Twitch IRC the dock now connects to Kick (Pusher WebSocket: chatroom resolution via the Kick API, App\\Events\\ChatMessageEvent parsing, session-token REST sending) and YouTube (Innertube polling: live-chat page continuation extraction + get_live_chat parsing, read-only); new rivulet-core::chat facade (ChatPlatform/ChatConfig/Chat, tungstenite client added to core), GUI platform selector with per-platform hints/notes, send gate (Twitch/Kick token, YouTube read-only hint), i18n keys EN/DE, end-to-end smoke tests against local WS and HTTP listeners, ci_pinning guard chat_dock_supports_kick_and_youtube, docs/README updated; YouTube endpoints are best-effort (not a stable public API)
- feat(discord): dynamic presence title line — the first card line (`details`) is now composed as "Rivulet · <Status>" (localized, e.g. "Rivulet · Bereit"/"Rivulet · Aufnahme"/"Rivulet · Streamt") so small hover cards identify Rivulet without the registration title; the game name stays on the second line (`state`) whenever a source is selected and is omitted otherwise. The literal bold app title row remains fixed by the Discord application registration (not changeable via the API). Wire/serialization, presence and GUI tests updated, docs/activity-status.md adjusted
- feat(gui): consolidate streaming into one Meld-style Stream workspace — the Stream tab is now a single broadcast page with an action bar (Start/Stop Streaming, stream-config shortcut), a left column embedding the chat dock (channel input, connect/disconnect, message list) and stream status/health/queue information, and a compact audio section at the bottom (Linux: master/output monitoring with the mixer openable from the same page); the chat dock no longer has its own sidebar entry (`AppView::Chat` removed), stream-information i18n keys (`stream_config`, `stream_information`, `open_mixer`, `output_monitoring`) added DE/EN, navigation/source-contract tests and docs/twitch-chat.md updated, ci_pinning guard `stream_workspace_embeds_chat_dock` added
- ci(release): extend the tag-based beta/RC/stable path in ci.yml with the same release hygiene as the alpha channel — the GitHub release now uses the commit-derived notes generator (`scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` → `body_path`, replacing GitHub's PR-based `generate_release_notes`), verifies the body for completeness (`check-release-notes.py --notes-file`, fails before publishing), generates and attaches a `SHA256SUMS` manifest over all assets (the updater previously would have failed closed on stable releases without one), mirrors the alpha file set (Discord assets, activity-status.md) with `fail_on_unmatched_files`, and the checkout fetches full history + tags; ci_pinning guard `tag_based_release_attaches_checksums_and_generated_notes`, CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- ci(release): verify release-notes completeness before publishing — new `scripts/check-release-notes.py` asserts the generated body covers every non-merge, non-prepare commit since the previous tag (conventional prefix stripped, multiset compare) and contains no `chore(release): prepare` leak; it runs in the release workflow against the exact body about to be published (`--notes-file`, fails before the release is created) and as a `--self-test` in the Lints job (fixture repos: end-to-end agreement, dropped bullet rejected, leaked prepare commit rejected); the generator gained an optional repo argument so the checker can validate fixtures; ci_pinning guard `release_notes_completeness_is_checked_in_ci`, CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- ci(release): auto-generate the GitHub release notes from the commits since the previous tag — new `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` renders the range `previous-tag..HEAD` grouped by conventional-commit type (Features/Bug fixes/Performance/Documentation/Build/CI/Tests/Refactoring/Housekeeping/Other), excludes the pipeline's own `chore(release): prepare` commits by subject (robust against retries where no bump commit sits at HEAD), and is printed via `body_path` instead of GitHub's PR-based `generate_release_notes` (which is sparse for direct-to-develop pushes); the release checkout now fetches full history + tags (`fetch-depth: 0`) so the generator can resolve the previous tag; the SHA256SUMS manifest stays attached; built-in `--self-test` fixture (grouping, prep-commit exclusion, previous-tag boundary) runs in the Lints job, ci_pinning guard `alpha_release_notes_are_generated_from_commits_since_last_tag`, CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- ci(fuzz): scheduled deep-fuzz campaign — new **Deep fuzz (weekly)** workflow (`.github/workflows/fuzz-deep.yml`) runs every Monday (and on demand via `workflow_dispatch`) with a 10-minute libFuzzer budget per target (`FUZZ_MAX_TOTAL_TIME=600` in `scripts/fuzz-smoke.sh`) and persists the grown corpus between runs through the actions cache (`fuzz/corpus/`, `restore-keys: fuzz-corpus-`, per-run save key; LRU eviction), so coverage accumulates instead of restarting from zero; the push-time smoke in ci.yml stays the fast gate; crashes upload as `fuzz-deep-crashes` artifact; ci_pinning guard `deep_fuzz_campaign_is_scheduled_with_corpus_persistence` + docs (fuzz/README.md, security.md, ci-action-pins.md)
- ci(release): serialize alpha release runs with a `release-alpha` concurrency group — two pushes in quick succession raced for the same next version number, release branch and GitHub release object (observed as `v0.65.0-alpha.109` tag-push rejections and an asset-upload "Not Found" while the sibling run mutated the release; the release itself landed complete); `cancel-in-progress: false` queues the latest run instead of discarding it; ci_pinning guard added
- ci(fuzz): install the glib/gstreamer pkg-config files (libglib2.0-dev, libgstreamer1.0-dev, libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev) in the fuzz smoke job — rivulet-core's gstreamer-rs -sys crates need them at build time even though the targets never touch GStreamer; nightly toolchain is now selected via the action's `toolchain:` input instead of a `#nightly` ref comment that generate-action-pins misread as a second branch pin; fuzz guard extended accordingly
- fix(security): validate shared-memory frame headers against forged geometry before reading — `FrameHeader::is_plausible` (core) rejects zero/absurd geometry, unknown pixel formats, `data_size` ≠ width×height×4 (checked u64 math), payloads above a 16 MiB cap and data beyond the mapping; readers now query the real mapping size (Windows `VirtualQuery`, Linux `fstat`-clamped mmap) instead of trusting DEFAULT_SHM_SIZE, copy pixels into a private snapshot immediately, and the Windows reader finally unmaps its view on drop; both writers (Vulkan layer, OpenGL hook DLL) compute `data_size` with checked multiplication and refuse geometry/data disagreement; 4 new capture-channel tests incl. overflow and cap cases, ci_pinning guard `shared_memory_frames_are_validated_before_read`, documented in docs/security.md
- test(security): cargo-fuzz targets for every untrusted-input parser with a CI smoke gate — new `fuzz/` crate (workspace-excluded) with libFuzzer targets `parse_irc_line` (Twitch IRC), `sdp_offer_endpoint` (WHIP endpoint → SDP generator, asserts structural invariants), `parse_latest_release` (GitHub release JSON, now `pub` for the target) and `parse_checksums` (SHA256SUMS manifest); CI job "Fuzz smoke (regression corpus)" builds with cargo-fuzz on the pinned nightly and runs 256 executions per target on Linux, failing the CI aggregate and uploading crash inputs on failure; `scripts/fuzz-smoke.sh` mirrors the job locally (sanitizer-aware: Windows without the VS ASan component skips with instructions, WSL/CI are the supported paths); ci_pinning guard pins targets, symbols, workspace exclusion and CI wiring; docs in fuzz/README.md, security.md and ci-action-pins.md
- feat(security): updater verifies release installers against a SHA256SUMS manifest before install — the release workflow generates `SHA256SUMS` over every attached asset (relative paths, sorted, `-r` for the empty edge case) and attaches it to the release; the updater downloads the manifest for the release tag (`releases/download/<tag>/SHA256SUMS`), looks up the asset name and compares digests fail-closed (missing entry, unreachable manifest, malformed digest and mismatch all refuse the install); the GUI download flow runs the verification between download and the Install button, a failure surfaces as an update error and the installer is never started; 6 updater unit tests incl. a local end-to-end manifest round-trip, 2 ci_pinning guards (workflow generation + GUI wiring, sha2 workspace dependency), docs in update-troubleshooting.md and security.md
- ci(wiki): backwards link audit — `audit-wiki-links.py --check-repo-docs` now also validates wiki references *from* the repo docs: deep `…/wiki/Page[#anchor]` links in docs/*.md, README and CONTRIBUTING must resolve to real wiki pages + heading anchors, and backticked page references must match canonical page names (separator-containing drift like "Getting Started" is reported; single-word identifiers such as the `streaming` commit scope are exempt); fixed the two drift findings in docs/wiki-content-policy.md (`Getting Started` → `Getting-Started`, `Fehlerbehebung und FAQ` → `Troubleshooting-und-FAQ`); wired into the wiki workflow and sync smoke, negative self-test + ci_pinning guard extended
- ci(wiki): full wiki link audit — `scripts/audit-wiki-links.py` now validates all three link kinds: interwiki pages + anchors (including the Languages.md template, code fences are ignored), repo-doc files + GitHub heading anchors, and external URL reachability (HEAD first, GET fallback, `--skip-external` for offline runs); wired into the scheduled wiki workflow and sync smoke check 4; negative self-tests + ci_pinning guard; live run: 86 interwiki + 17 repo-doc links + 2 external URLs across 21 pages, all clean
- docs(presence): add the id-rotation runbook to docs/activity-status.md — the exact steps for rotating the official Discord application id (portal prep, DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID bump, feat-commit + release-notes block, post-release verification via log/handshake/card/custom-id checks); ci_pinning guard keeps the runbook in the versioned docs
- feat(presence): guarded fallback chain for the Discord application id — `effective_client_id`/`effective_large_image_key` (rivulet-core::discord) resolve configured id → official default → adapter off, and the adapter reconcile uses them; this doubles as the retirement path for a deprecated app id: a release bumps `DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID`, documents the change in its release notes and reaches users via the regular updater (the release payload is the updater manifest); core chain tests + ci_pinning guard + docs updated
- ci(toolchain): pin the Rust toolchain via `rust-toolchain.toml` (channel 1.98.0, components rustfmt + clippy) — every local and CI `cargo` invocation now resolves to the exact same compiler/rustfmt, ending the rustfmt version flip-flop that reddened the Lints job in the alpha.100 window; pinned by a new ci_pinning guard and documented in docs/ci-action-pins.md
- feat(presence): zero-config Discord Rich Presence — Rivulet ships the official application id (`1544027006847680532`) and the `rivulet_logo` artwork as defaults, so the branded presence card (logo + status) works on first launch without creating a Discord application; both Settings fields remain as overrides for custom branding, an empty client id now restores the official default, and restores with an empty persisted id are migrated (custom ids stay untouched); core default test, GUI default/migration tests, ci_pinning guard, docs and wiki updated
- ci(release): trigger alpha releases from `build:`/`chore:`/`ci:` commits too — the release gate now treats `feat`/`fix`/`build`/`chore`/`ci` as releasable (build/chore/ci bump the patch version via `scripts/release-version.sh`), so packaging, housekeeping and CI changes ship automatically instead of needing a manual workflow dispatch (the alpha.98/alpha.99 gap); docs/test/style-only pushes still skip the release; ci_pinning guard + CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- build(packaging): ship the Discord Rich Presence setup files (app icon, Rich Presence artwork, activity-status docs) inside all three installers — Windows MSI/portable stage a `discord\` folder into the bundle (harvested into the MSI), the AppImage installs `usr/share/doc/rivulet/discord/`, the macOS bundle carries `Contents/Resources/discord/`, and the GitHub release additionally attaches the three files as standalone downloads; pinned by a new asset integration test
- feat(assets): add a dedicated Discord App Icon asset (`docs/assets/rivulet-app-icon-512.png`, 512×512) — a punchier small-avatar variant of the wave symbol on the dark brand gradient without padding, generated deterministically as step 8 in `scripts/generate-assets.sh`, registered in `scripts/check-assets.py`, covered by new asset contract tests and documented as the upload for the member-list icon swap
- docs(presence): document the Discord platform limit — the server member list renders only the application icon and the registered app name ("Rivulet"), never the payload `details`/`state` lines; the game-controller icon there is replaced by the portal **App Icon** (512×512), not by the Rich-Presence art asset
- feat(presence): mirror the configured art asset to `small_image` so the member list shows the logo instead of the game-controller placeholder — `large_image` renders on the profile card, Discord renders `small_image` in the server member list; the same uploaded asset key covers both (live-verified: Discord accepts and echoes large+small with the resolved asset id), wire-contract test + ci_pinning guard + docs updated
- feat(presence): swap the Discord status-message lines — `details` is Discord's first card line and now always carries the status label ("Recording"/"Aufnahme"), `state` is the second line and carries the selected game name; empty `state` is omitted (Discord rejects empty strings with 4000, same rule previously applied to `details`), the payload wire-contract test, ci_pinning guard and docs/activity-status.md were updated accordingly
- test(obs-ws): add a parallel handshake load test — `parallel_clients_all_complete_handshake_under_load` bursts 24 clients via a `Barrier` at one server, requires every client to complete Hello/Identify plus a request round-trip and a fresh client to still connect afterwards, permanently securing handshake stability under load; the duplicated retry loops in the smoke were unified onto the single `connect_with_retry` helper (`TestClient::connect` now delegates to it), ci_pinning guard + docs/obs-websocket.md updated
- fix(obs-ws): restore blocking on accepted sockets before the WebSocket handshake — the accept loop's non-blocking listener made Windows sockets inherit non-blocking mode, intermittently failing tungstenite's handshake read (`Protocol(HandshakeIncomplete)`) in the CI smoke under parallel load; the auth-rejection smoke now uses the same retry as TestClient::connect, ci_pinning guard + docs/obs-websocket.md updated
- feat(ui): warn immediately in Settings when the Discord presence payload would violate Discord's rules — Apply runs validate_set_activity_payload and shows a red warning for overlong status/game-name text (>128 chars) or an implausible art asset key (empty key stays valid, placeholder icon); DE/EN i18n, GUI tests, ci_pinning guard and docs/activity-status.md updated
- ci(presence): enforce Discord's SET_ACTIVITY validation rules in CI — a dedicated "Discord payload contract check" step serializes every payload variant (6 activities × 2 locales × game/no-game/long-game × asset/no-asset/bad-asset) and asserts the wire JSON satisfies the documented rules (empty `details` omitted, `state`/`details` ≤ 128 chars, plausible `large_image` key); `validate_set_activity_payload` exposes the same contract as a reusable pre-wire validator (`PayloadIssue::FieldTooLong`/`InvalidAssetKey`), the serializer now filters implausible asset keys instead of sending them verbatim (Discord silently drops the image), ci_pinning guard + docs/activity-status.md updated — so a 4000 rejection surfaces locally in CI instead of on a live Discord client
- feat(m5): reply in Twitch chat — the Chat view gains a message input (Enter/Send) that writes PRIVMSG via the worker; sending is non-blocking, gated on a connected chat with an OAuth token (`chat:send`), and never logs the token; core send smoke (local listener) + GUI gate tests + ci_pinning guard + docs updated
- fix(presence): omit the Discord activity `details` field when empty instead of sending an empty string — Discord rejects `SET_ACTIVITY` with `4000: "details" is not allowed to be empty` (verified live), which silently dropped every presence update whenever no game name was selected; regression test + ci_pinning guard + docs updated
- docs(presence): ship a ready-to-upload Discord Rich Presence artwork (`docs/assets/rivulet-rich-presence-1024.png`, 1024×1024 PNG with padding) and document the exact upload path (Developer Portal → Rich Presence → Art Assets, asset name `rivulet_logo`) plus size/format/padding requirements in docs/activity-status.md
- feat(m5): alert overlay import — Streamlabs/StreamElements widget URLs (and any custom https URL) can be imported into the browser source via a guided provider + token flow in the Scenes view; the token is cleared after import and never logged; core URL-shape/validation tests, GUI import tests, ci_pinning guard and docs/alerts.md added
- feat(presence): OBS-style Discord activity card — the payload now carries the art asset (`large_image`) uploaded in the Discord Developer Portal (configurable asset key in Settings, persisted), so the card shows Rivulet artwork instead of the generic placeholder icon; the layout splits state (plain status label) and details (selected game name) like OBS, and the app name is no longer duplicated into the payload (Discord renders it from the application registration); tests + ci_pinning guard + docs updated
- feat(m5): Twitch chat dock — native IRC client (`rivulet-core::twitch_chat`) with CAP/PASS/NICK/JOIN handshake, PING/PONG keepalive and IRCv3 tag parsing (colors, badges, broadcaster, `/me`), plus a Chat view in the sidebar (channel + optional OAuth token, bounded auto-scrolling message list, DE/EN i18n); anonymous read-only works without a token, tokens are never logged; documented in docs/twitch-chat.md (roadmap: docs/obs-vision-roadmap.md M5 community dock)
- fix(logging): log a cancelled recording save dialog at `info` level on all platforms (Windows, PipeWire portal, Linux fallback) instead of `debug`, so a Record press that never starts a capture is diagnosable from the daily log ("File selection cancelled" present = dialog cancelled; absent = no source selected); ci_pinning guard + docs updated
- refactor(streaming): remove the legacy `rivulet-streaming` crate — the pre-GStreamer FFmpeg prototype (`VideoEncoder` shelling out to `ffmpeg`, `Recorder`/`Encoder` placeholders, `record_screen`/`test_encoder` examples) was superseded by the `rivulet-core` GStreamer engine in M1 and is referenced by no crate in the workspace. The crate, its workspace-member entry, and the license-manifest pinning list are gone; the README no longer lists FFmpeg as a runtime prerequisite (only GStreamer remains) and the stale `ffmpeg/`/`ffmpeg.exe`/`ffplay.exe`/`ffprobe.exe` gitignore rules + repo-hygiene row were dropped with it
- feat(record): macOS screen/window recording (M5 Windows/macOS feature parity) — the Record view on macOS is no longer the "screen recording unavailable" placeholder: it lists monitors/windows via xcap (Screen-Recording-permission hint when empty), lets the user pick a monitor or window, preset and overlay, and records through the same GStreamer engine pipeline as Windows/Linux (codec/container, region crop for monitors, replay buffer, NDI, background stop finalization with the visible “Finalizing… → Recording saved.” status). New macOS-only app state + `refresh_macos_sources`/`start_macos_recording`/`drain_macos_frames`/`stop_macos_recording`/`draw_macos_record_view` (per-frame drain keeps the UI responsive; source validation happens before the file dialog), the record hotkey toggles the same path, and i18n keys `mac_permission_hint`/`mac_video_only_hint`/`mac_source_monitor`/`mac_source_window`/`mac_none` (EN+DE) were added. macOS-gated GUI tests cover the stop lifecycle, stale-selection resets and the no-source guard; a platform-independent source-contract test pins the Record-view wiring; docs/macos-recording.md added, README M5 parity row checked + beta-gate now reports criterion 3 met — live on-device verification remains a documented follow-up
- feat(audio): macOS audio capture for the recording pipeline — `rivulet-audio` gains a cpal backend behind the same `AudioCapture` API: the microphone is captured from the default input device, system audio ("what you hear") from an installed loopback driver (BlackHole/Soundflower/VB-Cable); without one, system capture is skipped with a `system_source_note()` hint the Record view surfaces instead of failing the recording. Device-native samples (f32/i16/u16) are converted to interleaved f32, mapped to stereo (mono duplicated, >2ch keep the first pair) and linearly resampled to the engine rate in the new cross-platform `dsp` helpers. The macOS GUI enables the engine's separate audio tracks and drains system/mic frames per-frame into `push_audio_track` (AudioTrack::System/Microphone) like Linux, with pause/mute discarding frames; audio filters, per-source sliders and live monitoring remain documented follow-ups. Unit tests: sample-format conversion, channel mapping, resampling (identity/up/down/stereo) + macOS-gated construct test in rivulet-audio (20 tests); GUI source-contract test extended for the audio wiring; docs/macos-recording.md, README and i18n (mac_audio_hint, EN+DE) updated

## [0.65.0-alpha.55] - 2026-08-30
- feat(ui): validate the Discord client id on Apply in Settings — a non-numeric value, wrong length, or pasted URL shows an immediate warning instead of silently keeping the adapter off; core validator + tests + ci_pinning guard added — shown while the adapter is not connected and a client id is configured; it rebuilds the worker + handshake without restarting the app (tests + ci_pinning guard added) `[opcode:u32][length:u32]` (op 0 = HANDSHAKE, op 1 = FRAME) — the old 4-byte-only framing was rejected by Discord with `{"code":1003,"message":"protocol error"}`, so the status never appeared even with a valid client ID and pipe; verified live against a running Discord client (READY reply), wire tests assert the opcodes end to end, and a ci_pinning guard locks the framing in — EnvFilter::from_default_env() filtered out everything when RUST_LOG was unset, so the daily log stayed empty (no startup, engine, or Discord diagnostics at all); an explicit RUST_LOG still overrides the default; regression tests + ci_pinning guard added — the worker now logs every IPC success/failure (visible in the crash logs) and exposes a shared connection state; the Stream view shows whether the handshake was accepted ("Connected") instead of silently showing only Discord's plain game-detection card; tests + ci_pinning guard + docs updated — save() wrote the eframe storage but nothing read it back, silently dropping every configured setting (theme, Discord client id, hotkeys, OBS WebSocket, MIDI presets, …); RivuletApp::new now restores via eframe::get_value under APP_KEY and re-attaches the live engine + CLI timeout; eframe-storage round-trip tests and a ci_pinning guard added
- docs(presence): add a state-reference table to docs/activity-status.md covering all six states — DE/EN labels, trigger conditions, and transitions; the ci_pinning guard now keeps the documented table in sync with the model
- feat(ui): add a status legend to the Stream view — one row per presence state with a hover tooltip explaining when it appears and what it means; the active state is highlighted, keys are localized DE/EN and pinned by ci_pinning
- feat(presence): wire the previously unused PresenceActivity::Error state — engine/capture failures surface as a localized "Error"/"Fehler" status with priority over activity labels, streaming starts clear stale errors, and the payload never leaks the raw error text (tests + docs updated)
- fix(presence): sync Discord Rich Presence from the global UI update every frame, not only while the Stream view is visible — starting/stopping a recording now updates the Discord status from any tab; regression + ci_pinning guards added, docs updated
- fix(ui): make tabs responsive — the central view content and the navigation sidebar now live in scroll areas (controls stay reachable when the window is shrunk) and main.rs sets a minimum window size; responsive layout is covered by ui_smoke/ui_accessibility/ui_regression source-contract tests and a ci_pinning guard
- feat(m5): MIDI learn mode (capture the next moved control into the add-binding row without dispatching it) and per-device mapping presets (save/apply/delete, keyed by stable port name) in Settings
- feat(m5): add MIDI controller mapping (Korg NanoKontrol etc.) — hardware-free parse/dispatch core in `rivulet-core::midi` (Note/CC → scene switch, master-volume fader, mute, chroma-key toggle), `midir` device bridge in the GUI, Settings section with device picker and binding table, persisted bindings, i18n DE/EN (see docs/midi.md)
- ci: install libasound2-dev on Linux for the midir ALSA backend; add CI wiring test for the MIDI mapping
- feat(m5): add OBS WebSocket v5 remote control server (`rivulet-obs-websocket`) for Stream Deck / TouchPortal — scenes, sources, recording/streaming control, optional SHA-256 auth, event subscriptions, request batches; verified end-to-end with a real WebSocket client (#72)
- feat(gui): wire OBS WebSocket server into Settings (enable/port/password), bridge it to the real scene manager/engine, and broadcast GUI-initiated changes to connected clients (see docs/obs-websocket.md)
- feat(presence): add opt-out, non-blocking Discord Rich Presence adapter (`rivulet-core::discord`) with IPC + graceful degradation
- feat(presence): wire opt-out toggle into the Stream view and persist it
- feat(presence): include the user-selected game/source name in the presence state; make the Discord application client ID configurable in Settings

## [Unreleased]

- ci(signing-e2e): fix macOS smoke test — a self-signed test cert is never *trusted*, so `security find-identity -v` reported "0 valid identities" and signing aborted; the signer now lists every codesigning identity (no `-v`), imports via the canonical `-A -t cert -f pkcs12` recipe, and skips the RFC3161 timestamp so the test stays offline (p12 is generated with legacy algorithms and a CA:FALSE leaf cert because macOS 26 rejects OpenSSL 3's modern defaults)

- ci(signing-e2e): fix Windows Pester test — cert generation and root-store trust both hang on the runner, so a throwaway cert is committed as a fixture; cmd.exe's Microsoft signature can't be stripped (`signtool remove` fails with 0x57), so the applied signature is nested and is verified with `signtool verify /all /v`; make the RFC3161 timestamp skippable; fix Pester 5 scoping; add job timeouts; test renamed to `sign-pester.tests.ps1`
